        "description": "1998. HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named \"Best PC Game Ever\" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.<br><br>\r\n\t\tNOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.<br><br>\r\n\t\tThe player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.<br><br>\r\n\t\tThe intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source&reg;, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:<br><br>\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \"muscles,\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story&reg; and Monster's, Inc.&reg;, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>",

        "description": "Fight in the theatre of war that changed the world forever. Battle alongside your compatriots on some of the most inhospitable environments of the Eastern Front in Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45. Red Orchestra places you in the most realistic WWII first-person multi-player combat to date on the PC, allowing the player to fight through some of the most intense combat of the war. You can play as infantry, using a wide range of infantry weapons, or crew one of the many armored combat vehicles available in the game, from half-tracks to the most famous German and Soviet heavy tanks. Engage the enemy with everything in your arsenal, from your bayonet at close quarters up to the massive 122mm cannon on the Soviet IS-2. And if that isn't enough, find an officer and a radio to call in thunderous artillery strikes to shake the enemy loose.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul><li>Crew 16 fully realized vehicles with highly detailed exterior and interior models <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Choose from 30 authentic infantry weapons <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Full 50+ player online Multiplayer Support<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Unique Setting - the only FPS to focus on the WWII Russian Front<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Engage enemy tanks at 800 metres and more with the Simulation-level armored vehicle combat<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Fight the full range of combined arms infantry and vehicle combat in detailed environments based on real-world data, from city-centre to deeply rural settings <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Realistic bullet and projectile ballistics will make you duck for cover <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Coordinate strategies with your team-mates via Voice Over IP <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Authentic Immersive Sound FX and 3d Positional Sound System <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>3D 'Iron Sights' and unique 3D scope system <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>True weapon deployment system including resting rifles on support<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Historically accurate artillery system <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Distance-based sound system dynamically creates the battle ambiance<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Advanced player movement system featuring diving over obstacles and leaning <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Custom 8 way animation system for highly realistic player animations </li></ul>New for Summer '07<br>\t\t\t\t\tThis update includes a new map, a new vehicle and some major graphical enhancements to the game and is available to owners of the game for free through Steam. The new map - Krivoi Rog - gives players the largest tank slugfest to date, with 16 square kilometers of terrain, 3000 meter viewable range and up to 50 players. This map also features the new vehicle - the German Panzer IV G, providing the German players with some additional fire-power for the mid-war period.<br>\t\t\t\t\tIn addition to the new map and vehicle, an all-new adaptive bloom system has been added for the game's graphics, making the bloom crystal-clear even at low resolutions. For further eye-candy, Anti-Aliasing and Anisotropic Filtering settings are now configurable in-game.<br>\t\t\t\t\tNew for Spring '07<br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul><li>Ten new maps, the winning entries in Tripwire's Custom Map Competition.

To cap it off, the BT-7 even carries tank-riders.<br><strong>&quot;Black Day July&quot;:</strong> one of the very best for tank combat fans, set in the rolling countryside around Prokhorovka as German and Russian armor clash en masse during the Battle of Kursk.<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Increased player limits. A new level of intensity with 50+ player multiplayer battles (up from the previous limit of 32).<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>New community made content, including the Russian BT-7 light tank with infantry tank riders and the first player controllable anti-tank gun in the game.<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>New soundtrack: The &quot;Orchestra&quot; comes to the Ostfront - the game now features a complete in-game soundtrack from composer Matthew Burns.<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Gameplay enhancements.

Your mission is to successfully exterminate your enemy's civilian population whilst saving your own. Points are awarded or lost depending on both the efficacy and thoroughness of your nuclear vendetta and the number of your own civilian deaths.  In order to win you must wipe out the enemy population and simultaneously disable the enemy's ability to retaliate against you. This is an extremely difficult task since launching an attack on the enemy exposes the positions of your own Ground Silos, Subs and Bombers the moment they launch nuclear weapons, making you extremely vulnerable and exposed to a crushing counter-attack. <br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDesperate attempts must be made to form fast, tactical alliances, alliances that may at any moment break-down to become the treacherous and most deadly of betrayals. Everyone looks to each other in a state of nervous suspense and paranoid accusation. In all-out nuclear Armageddon, everybody dies, everybody loses, you just have to make sure you lose the least!",

        "description": "Call of Duty® 2 redefines the cinematic intensity and chaos of battle as seen through the eyes of ordinary soldiers fighting together in epic WWII conflicts. The sequel to 2003's Call of Duty, winner of over 80 Game of the Year awards, Call of Duty 2 offers more immense, more intense, more realistic battles than ever before, thanks to the stunning visuals of the new COD™2 engine.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul><li>The #1 WWII shooter development team returns with an amazing new experience: Developed by Infinity Ward, creators of the award-winning Call of Duty. All-new, unprecedented enhancements from stunningly realistic graphics to seamless gameplay, thanks to the revolutionary COD2 engine, groundbreaking AI, and choice-based gameplay innovations. Beautifully rendered snow, rain, fog, and smoke, combined with dynamic lighting and shadows, make this the most intense WWII shooter yet.<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>New conflicts and enemies to face: Call of Duty 2 brings you bigger battles, with more tanks, troops, and explosions on-screen, and bigger scope, with a wide range of locales and environments across the European Theater. Fight &quot;The Desert Fox&quot; across the scorching sands of North Africa as wave upon wave of tanks clash in the desert. Use rocket-propelled grappling hooks alongside your Army Ranger squad to storm and scale the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc against a relentless German counterassault, and slog through urban chaos as a tank hunter in war-torn Russia. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Rely on your squad as never before: The dozens of Allied soldiers surrounding you are fully aware of the changing situations around them, and will let you know using an all-new, context-sensitive battle chatter system. They will draw enemy fire, lay down cover for you, use foxholes and moving tanks for cover, and warn you of incoming enemy troops and hostile fire.<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Choice-based gameplay: Play through missions in the order you see fit. Will you decide to play first as a sniper or as a tank commander? It's your call. Open-ended battlefields allow you to individualize your tactics and choose the order in which you complete your objectives. <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Multiplayer Mayhem: Go online for intense Axis vs. Allies team-based multiplayer action, building on the hugely popular Call of Duty multiplayer modes.</li></ul>",

Xpand Rally also features highly detailed models of modern rally cars and handling physics developed with the help of rally sport professionals which further enhance the realism of driving experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXpand Rally combines the best elements of Rally and Rally Cross racing in one unique gaming experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game offers a career mode based on time trials during both individual races and World Championship Series which will satisfy traditional Rally fans. The Rally Cross fans won't be disappointed either - they can challenge several opponents in head to head racing during competitions based on real and fictitious race events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXpand Rally, as the only title on the market, brings the economy factor into a rally game. The player starts with a junk car and competes in races to earn money and acquire upgrades, repair damage, tweak performance and pay the race entry fees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with the tuning-up, the car's condition affects its handling. Due to accurate damage system, it is highly dependent on the player's driving skills. The physical handling model is also influenced by car parts configuration and provides both authentic feel and joy of driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interactive race track surroundings with enhanced game physics and the innovative approach to changing daytime and weather conditions, both influencing the car handling, are other hallmarks of Xpand Rally that distinguish it from other racing games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time among rally games Xpand Rally includes a complete set of easy-to-use editing tools enabling to create new tracks, cars or even game mods.",

His solve rate is the best in the bureau....perhaps too good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile investigating the growing list of serial killers, Agent Thomas concludes that something is twisting the bodies and souls of those that society has left behind. The homeless, addicted and deranged are rising from the city’s underbelly and committing mindless acts of violence. Could there be an unseen connection between the increasing brutality of the latest serial killings and the increasing crime rate? This question is pushed to the forefront after Agent Thomas is framed for the murder of two police officers. Now he must solve the murders to stop the killings, and exonerate himself from the crimes of which he is accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs FBI agent Ethan Thomas, you rely on sharp instincts and sophisticated forensic tools to investigate crime scenes, collect evidence, and find clues that will lead you to the killers. With danger lurking in every shadow, you need whatever weapons you can find to stay alive. If you run out of bullets, you’ll have to fight with a fire axe, shovel, pipe, two-by-four, or whatever you can pry from the environment around you. You’ll need to make sure nothing stops you as you try to uncover exactly who...or what is behind the grisly killings plaguing the city.",

Thus, England is the mightiest sea power, Austria has powerful light and heavy cavalry, and Cossacks are the pride of the Ukrainian army.<br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBattles of up to 8,000 units may be conducted on single or network game maps. One can carry out lingering city sieges, wage guerilla wars, capture commanding heights and arrange ambushes, deploy landing forces on enemy shores, and conduct sea battles. The game system is arranged to reduce per-unit control and resource micromanagement, and to turn to global goals of powerful economy formation, science development, the capturing of new lands, and defending borders.",

        "description": "Let the battle begin! The Cossacks II: Battle for Europe add-on continues the renowned Cossacks II:Napoleonic Wars game. It depicts the rather short historic period of the Napoleonic wars. The Napoleon wars changed Europe forever, leading to the formation of empires and putting an end to almost one thousand years of constant strife between small states. The game provides mass-scale battles between thousands-strong armies of the nations involved in conflicts during this period. The theatres of operation introduce France, Britain, Austria, Russia, Prussia, Egypt, and three nations not represented in the original game – Spain, the Grand Duchy of Warsaw (Poland), and the Confederation of the Rhine.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Cossacks II: Battle for Europe reconstructs in detail the soldiers' uniforms weapons and architecture of each nation. Each nation's army has its unique units and possibilities. The game includes over 180 units 190 buildings and 1200 flora and fauna elements. When developing the combat system the peculiarities of early 19th century warring were taken into account as was the value of formations provisions and troop morale. Tactical tricks utilized by military commanders of the time are fully reflected in the game. An &quot;honest&quot; system of bullet and cannonball ballistics based on physics is an innovative addition to the Cossacks engine. Other engine features include 3-dimensional landscaping which creates realistic-looking scenery and towns and impacts combat tactics. For example the firing range of a subdivision of soldiers or a cannon positioned at the top of a hill is greater than the firing range of a unitstationed on flat terrain. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\tKey features:\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul><li>Control the French, Russians, Austrians, Britons, Prussians, or Egyptians -- master new weapons and tactics during a time that redefined the meaning of modern warfare.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Fight through historically inspired battles of the 19th century, with massive armies colliding in different types of terrain and weather.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Battles on real historical scale with tens of thausands of units on one map.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Realistic Troop Morale System - Well-fed troops live longer and grow in experience to become valuable battlefield assets, while fierce and overwhelming opponents, or marching long distances will cause morale to drop<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Enhanced diplomacy tools help you create treaties that give you the advantages<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>",

Each team, alien and human, has a Commander. The Commander looks down on the battlefield and issues orders, places structures, collects resources, researches technology, and deploys abilities. <br><br>Here are some gameplay examples: A human Commander could drop health packs and ammunition to a trapped marine squad, and deploy sentry guns to help them defend their position. Or an alien Commander could grow a new Hive to spread infestation throughout newly captured territory, allowing more alien eggs to spawn...<br><br>Two Unique Sides<br>Aliens players choose to evolve into one of five lifeforms: The fast, fearsome Skulk can run on walls and deliver massive damage with its jaws. Lerks fly and deploy gasses to support their teammates in battle. Gorges heal other lifeforms and build tunnels, hydra turrets, walls, and other tactical structures. Fades blink in and out of battle, picking off marines with giant scythes. Finally, the giant Onos is so massive and so tough, that even entire marine squads can't take it down.<br><br>Marines wield rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, pistols, and other weapons. Cluster grenades can clear ventilation shafts of sneaky Skulks, flamethrowers make short work of alien structures and infestation, and boosts dropped by the Commander increase combat effectiveness. <br><br>When attacking on foot doesn't cut it, marines can construct hulking Exosuits wielding miniguns and railguns, and equip jetpacks for high speed assaults on alien Hives.<br><br>Long Term Development<br>Natural Selection 2 receives constant updates.

Along for the ride are award-winning journalist Maggie Robbins and internationally renowned geologist Ludger Brink.<br>\t\t\t\tOnce the wayward asteroid is nuked into a safe orbit, the trio conducts a routine examination of the rocky surface.<br>\t\t\t\tWhat they uncover is anything but routine.<br>\t\t\t\tLow, Brink and Robbins unwittingly trigger a mechanism that transforms the asteroid into a crystal-like spacecraft. The team is hurtled across the galaxy to a planet so desolate, Brink is moved to name it Cocytus, after the 9th circle of Hell in Dante’s inferno. The bleak landscape was obviously once home to a highly evolved civilization, with remnants of sophisticated architecture, advanced technology and an intricate network of underground tunnels.<br>\t\t\t\tBut no Cocytans.<br>\t\t\t\tWho were the original inhabitants of this once rich empire-turned-wasteland? What are those apparitions that mysteriously appear from time to time? Why have Low, Robbins, and Brink been brought to this place?

To return to Earth, they must dig for answers, both on the planet’s surface and deep within themselves.<br>\t\t\t\tFrom the combined talents of LucasArts and legendary Steven Spielberg comes an epic adventure that plunges headlong into the very core of the unknown.

These ships are small, fast and agile, and extremely dangerous due to the on-board torpedo launchers. But they are also the most vulnerable of all military vessels. More than once in the history of WWII, a handful of those little deadly boats helped decide the course of an entire battle and executed seemingly impossible missions.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>They were called the \"mosquito fleet\" because of their unique combat tactics. Using speed and agility, dodging enemy fire, PT boats approached seemingly giant enemy ships in a fight of David against Goliath, stung them with well aimed torpedo volleys - and immediately withdrew!</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The casualties were immense, but the results often worth these lives and sacrifices. These small heroes of the great war made an unforgettable contribution to the Allied victory.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKey features:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>The game combines key elements of a strategic, tactical and action simulator\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>The player can control each crew member separately, or command whole groups of ships\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Flexible options allow the player to fully customize the game difficulty\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Military units are recreated using authentic historical documents\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>All game objects use real-life physics\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Beautiful and realistic sea and ambiance effects never seen before\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Support of DirectX 10 and multi-core processors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>",

This is the time of the Maelstrom. In this ravaged world, the planet's dwindling resources have divided what remains of mankind in two: the urban freedom fighting 'Remnants' and the technologically advanced 'Ascension'. Now they must wage war against a new threat, the invasion of a savage alien race, the Hai-Genti, and each other in a desperate struggle for supremacy and survival. Through the game's missions, take command from different viewpoints and employ faction-specific tactics and weaponry to achieve your objectives. Complete with the ability to terraform landscapes and transform units, Maelstrom provides gamers with the power to harness the forces of nature in the most frantic, destructive, action-packed RTS game yet.                    <br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul><li>A stunning mix of action-packed RTS missions set in a totally destructible and immaculately realised environment.                       <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>A devastated future Earth becomes the battleground as a divided human race fights for survival against alien invaders.                      <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Through the game, players control each of the game's three factions - the Remnants, Ascension and the alien Hai-Genti - each with unique identities, strengths and tactics.                      <br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Modify the terrain and use the elements as a strategic weapon.

Welcome to the 1980s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the decade of big hair, excess and pastel suits comes a story of one man's rise to the top of the criminal pile. Vice City, a huge urban sprawl ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz to the ghetto, was one of the most varied, complete and alive digital cities ever created. Combining open-world gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town brimming with delights and degradation and given the opportunity to take it over as you choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself.",
